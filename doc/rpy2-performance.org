* Python-Rpy2 performance issues with genenetwork2

At one point, genenetwork2 was down. A possible cause was that it
wrote into the log file in an infinite loop due to rpy2(v3.4.4), so a
solution was to empty it. Currently, as a work around, rpy2 is
disabled by removing it's imports. This affects WGCNA/ CTL imports and
commenting out Biweight Midcorrelation option in the trait page. See:

** Reproducing the problem

I went back to commit #b8408cea. With regards to logs, I never
experienced any log issue. Perhaps it's because of how I start my
server:

: env SERVER_PORT=5004 TMPDIR=/home/bonface/tmp WEBSERVER_MODE=DEBUG LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG GENENETWORK_FILES=/home/bonface/data/genotype_files/ GN2_PROFILE=/home/bonface/opt/python3-genenetwork2 ./scripts/run_debug.sh

However, when loading the homepage, I occasionally ran into this trace:

#+begin_src

DEBUG:wqflask.views:.shutdown_session: remove db_session

This blocks the flask service. Seems to be related to: [[https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2/issues/769][rpy2-issue#769]]
and [[https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2/issues/809][rpy2-issue#809]]. I tried to reproduce this problem using some endpoint:

#+begin_src python
@app.route("/test")
  def test():
      from rpy2 import robjects as ro
      from rpy2 import rinterface
      from threading import Thread

      def rpy2_init_simple():
          rinterface.initr_simple()

      thread = Thread(target=rpy2_init_simple)
      thread.start()
      return "This is a test after importing rpy2"
#+end_src

which generates this trace:

#+begin_src
/home/bonface/opt/python3-genenetwork2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/rpy2/rinterface.py:955: UserWarning: R is not initialized by the main thread.
              Its taking over SIGINT cannot be reversed here, and as a
              consequence the embedded R cannot be interrupted with Ctrl-C.
              Consider (re)setting the signal handler of your choice from
              the main thread.
warnings.warn(
DEBUG:wqflask.views:.shutdown_session: remove db_session

#+end_src

Modifying the endpoint to:

#+begin_src python
@app.route("/test")
  def test():
      import wqflask.correlation.show_corr_results
      import wqflask.ctl.ctl_analysis
      import time
      from wqflask.correlation.correlation_functions import cal_zero_order_corr_for_tiss

      print("Sleeping for 3 seconds")
      time.sleep(3)
      return "This is a test after importing rpy2"
#+end_src

and refreshing the page a couple of times, I get:

#+begin_src
DEBUG:wqflask.views:.check_access_permissions: @app.before_request check_access_
permissions

#+end_src

However, this seems to be non-deterministic, in the sense that I can't
really pin what causes the above. I've tried to write a Locust Test
that simulates users hitting that endpoint:

#+begin_src python
"""Load test a single trait page"""
from locust import HttpUser, task, between


  class LoadTest(HttpUser):
      wait_time = between(1, 2.5)

      @task
      def fetch_trait(self):
          """Fetch a single trait"""
          self.client.get("/test")
#+end_src


** A possible solution

From this [[https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2/issues/809#issuecomment-845923975][comment]], a possible reason for the above traces, is that
from Flask's end, a [[https://tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node20.html][SIGPIPE]] is somehow generated by our Python
code. However, at this particular point, the R thread just happens to
be running, and R can't handle this correctly. This seems to have been
fixed in this [[https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2/pull/810][PR]] with a this [[https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2/issues/809#issuecomment-851618215][explanation]]. On our end, to have these
changes, we have to update our python-rpy2 version.
